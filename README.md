# matherial.io
The repository of the website https://matherial.io

I update this repo every time I change the site.

It contains the most important folder: [wp-content](https://github.com/Benkex/matherial.io/tree/main/wp-content), and other relevant folders and files.

If you want to help with this project, or if you have any ideas, suggestions etc. please write to [info at matherial dot io](mailto: info@matherial.io)! Thank you! :-)
